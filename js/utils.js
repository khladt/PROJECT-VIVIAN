            'For the sake of clarity, I will refer to it as <b>“The Beast.”</b><br><br>' +

            'The Beast is not a creature in the conventional sense.<br>' +
            'It does not hunt. It does not judge.<br>' +
            'But It does seem aware of us as individuals. That is… something.<br><br>' +

            'The Beast is better understood as a living architecture of thought, memory, and possibility.<br>' +
            'A universe that behaves less like a machine…<br>' +

            `I have identified three distinct layers within the Beast. For ease of communication, I'll borrow psychological terminology.<br><br>` +

            '<b>1. THE ULTRA EGO</b><br>' +
            'These are the <b>Worlds of Rule</b>.<br>' +
            'Places governed by consistency: gravity, causality, time, logic.<br><br>' +

            `This would explain why it's shattered, and why every <b>World Shard</b> is somehow connected to The In-between and The Black Pyramid.<br><br>`,

            '<b>3. THE ID (The Void / The Unknown)</b><br>' +

            'Contact with the Id results in cognitive dissolution, loss of identity, or worse outcomes I am unwilling to document further...<br><br>' +

            `Studies of, or contact with, anything regarding the Id is <b>prohibited.</b><br>` +
