            <h2>Who Am I? 👋</h2>
            <p>
                I'm <b>Khlad Thabit</b>, the solo developer and general creator behind everything you see here. I'm currently finishing my Software Engineering degree, and this studio is where I merge my technical background with my passion for creative expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                K.T. STUDIO is my personal umbrella for a range of projects, from dynamic web experiences like "PROJECT VIVIAN" motion comic, to Digital artworks, and independent game development on platforms like Itch.io. My goal is simple: Build an immersive, unforgettable fictional worlds.
            </p>

            <h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the Hood: Motion Comic Engine ⚙️</h2>
            <p>
                The core experience you saw on the home page "PROJECT VIVIAN" is built on a responsive, high-performance web framework designed specifically for sequential, cinematic storytelling. It's not a video; it's a live animation running entirely in your browser.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scroll = Timeline: I used GSAP ScrollTrigger to treat the browser scroll as a video timeline, allowing layered elements to move at different speeds to create a powerful parallax illusion of depth.</li>
                <li>Fluid Design: Every element's size and position is defined using responsive units (`vw` and `vh`) to ensure the aspect ratio and motion remain perfect, whether you're viewing on a desktop or a tablet.</li>
                <li>Smart Performance: To ensure smooth gameplay across all devices, I implemented a custom fallback system that smartly detects low-spec phones and serves a stable, static image instead of complex, multi-layered parallax.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="itch-io-games">Other Creations: Games, Devlogs, and Art 🎮</h2>
            <p>
                While web animation is a focus, my heart lies in game development. K.T. STUDIO is the label for all my independent releases. Head over to my Itch.io page to check out my game development projects and art assets, or subscribe to my YouTube channel where I (sometimes) release devlogs on project I'm currently working on.

            <h2 id="my-tools">My Tools (ALL FREE & OPEN-SOURCE) 🛠️</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything I create, from the code that powers this site to the sound design in my games, is built using **100% open-source tools**. I believe in the power and freedom of community-driven software, and it runs on my favorite system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the key tools I used to create assets for "PROJECT VIVIAN" and for my other projects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" class="list-title">Game Engine: The Godot Engine</a>
                        <br>It's an incredibly lightweight and powerful engine that's constantly evolving, especially with the Godot 4.0 release. I fell in love with it for its intuitive UI, seamless scene management, and wonderfully lively community.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        
                        <a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank" class="list-title">2D Assets/Painting: Krita</a>
                        <br>All character art, backgrounds, and UI elements are painted/Drawn in Krita. It’s a professional-grade painting program that makes creating detailed 2D assets both powerful and free.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" class="list-title">3D Modeling: Blender</a>
                        <br>The industry-standard for open-source 3D. When I need complex models, environmental pieces, or stylized assets for my game projects, Blender handles everything from modeling to rendering.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                        <br>I use Kdenlive to assemble devlogs, project trailers, and motion comic video assets. It provides all the professional-level editing features needed without any subscription fees.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                        <br>For building branching narratives and planning complex dialogue paths, Twine is my go-to. It makes organizing interconnected story elements straightforward and visual.
